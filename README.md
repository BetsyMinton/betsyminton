<h2>Hi, I'm Betsy Minton 👋 </h2>

<h3>My Story 📖</h3> 
<p>I got hooked on tech as a toddler when my dad brought home an Apple IIe. He color-coded my disks 💾 for me since I couldn't read yet. I had a smattering of coding experiences as a child.  Some BASIC from my dad, some LEGO Logo at school, but that was about it.  Life took me in a different direction, and I didn't get back into coding until I was an adult teaching kindergarten.  I heard about the <a href="https://hourofcode.com/us" target="_blank">Hour of Code</a> and this adorable little robot called <a href="https://www.terrapinlogo.com/bee-bot-family.html" target="_blank">Bee-Bot</a>.  I wanted to give my kindergarteners the same experiences I had as a kid and more.  Slowly I taught myself how to code again in block languages with Code.org, Scratch, and Mindstorms.  I also learned some HTML.  When I started my master's degree, I knew I wanted to combine my love of tech with my love of helping people.  I finally was able to take the formal front-end development classes I needed to consider myself a "real" coder.</p>
<h3>My Profession 👩🏼‍💻</h3>
<p>Now that I run my own business, I get to put my education and experience to work.  I love coding and creating.  I help small businesses and non-profits with web development, graphics, social media, and branding.  I also help educators and schools through professional development and curriculum design.  I love maintaining a variety of interests since it helps me keep learning and fuels my creativity.  If you have a tech project you need help with, I'd love to meet with you and see how I can help.
